# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 1, 2021

**Today's Progress:** I forked the [Unicorn Project] (https://github.com/aradoi/unicorn) and took the time to create my dev environment - cleaned old python2.7, updated pip, npm and cdk. 

**Thoughts:** Happy about onboarding this challenge. I'm sure there is a lot to discover along the way.
