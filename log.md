# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 1, 2021

**Today's Progress:** I forked the [Unicorn Project] (https://github.com/aradoi/unicorn) and took the time to create my dev environment - cleaned old python2.7, updated pip, npm and cdk. 

**Thoughts:** Happy about onboarding this challenge. I'm sure there is a lot to discover along the way.

### Day 2: February 2, 2021

**Today's Progress:** I continued with learning CDK code structure and CLI commands, for the purpose of interacting with AWS resources (via CF) through a high level programming language (I chose Python). I did update the environment with last pip, python and cdk. I created a dedicated AWS IAM user principle for cdk.

**Thoughts:** We're moving away from low-level representations of cloud resources as there were first represented in their native language, in favor of more abstract ones (e.g. Python vs. CF). The balance must be kept between simplicity and granularity.
